This is the directory where ISIS stores INSTALLED LIBRARIES.  These
are the versions of ISIS programs used in, e.g., run_isis

Run "make install" one level above this to initiate installation.
Many sites will also want to install symbolic links from the system
library area (/usr/lib) pointing to these installed libraries.
