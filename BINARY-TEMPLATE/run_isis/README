This is the directory from which we normally run ISIS for "production"
purposes.  It uses binaries from ../bin and has symbolic links for 
convenience in starting the various demo programs.  

To start ISIS here you will need to edit the "sites" file in this
directory to delete references to Cornell machines are replace them
with definitions for your own machine.

Lines have the format
	+ ss: uport,tport,bport machinename primaryscope[,scope2,...]
Where:
	* The + sign indicates that the entry is "active"
	* ss is a site number and must be unique
	* uport is the ISIS "udp port" number.  Pick anything > 1024.
	* tport is the ISIS "tcp port" number.   "     "         "
	* tport is the ISIS "bcast port" number. "     "         "
	  ... most people also list this in /etc/services, i.e.
                     isis       1601/udp	# for ISIS site-site
                     isis       1602/tcp	# for connect to ISIS
                     isis       1603/bcast	# for isis startup
	* machinename is your machine name, normally fully qualified.  Must
	  be possible to find it using gethostbyname() (i.e. listed in the
	  /yp/etc/hosts file).  ISIS matches the output of hostname() in this
	  file, so make sure that hostname echos a reasonable name.
	* primaryscope is the name of your institution.  ALL SITES IN YOUR
          LAN normally have the same primaryscope.  This is used for group
          namespace creation and if you use different values for different
          machines, they will have different "namespace scopes".
	* scope2, etc. are optional scopes.  We often list machines by type
	  for convenience here.  Not required and can differ from entry to
	  entry even within a LAN.

With this change ISIS should start right up if you run "isis" from here.

If the system seems not to have been installed, try
	cd ..; make ; make install
