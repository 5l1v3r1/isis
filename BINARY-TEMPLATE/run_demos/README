This is the directory from which we normally run ISIS for "demos" and test
purposes.  It uses binaries from ../demos or ../util and has symbolic links
for convenience in starting the various demo programs.  It uses port
numbers that differ from the ones in the run_isis directory so that
you can test a new ISIS out without disrupting the installed one.

To start ISIS here you will need to edit the "sites" file in this
directory to delete references to Cornell machines are replace them
with definitions for your own machine.

Lines have the format
	+ ss: uport,tport,bport machinename primaryscope[,scope2,...]
Where:
	* The + sign indicates that the entry is "active"

	* ss is a site number and must be unique, 1-127.  Leading zeros
          do not designate octal, by the way.

	* uport is the ISIS "udp port" number.  Pick anything > 1024.
	* tport is the ISIS "tcp port" number.   "     "         "
	* tport is the ISIS "bcast port" number. "     "         "
	  These will normally NOT be the numbers in the run_isis sites
	  file and will normally NOT be listed in the /etc/services file.
          You will need to specify these numbers as command-line options or
          in the environment variable ISISPORT to get ISIS to use it.

	* machinename is your machine name, normally fully qualified.  Must
	  be possible to find it using gethostbyname() (i.e. listed in the
	  /yp/etc/hosts file).  ISIS matches the output of hostname() in this
	  file, so make sure that hostname echos a reasonable name.

	* primaryscope is the name of your institution.  ALL SITES IN YOUR
          LAN normally have the same primaryscope.  This is used for group
          namespace creation and if you use different values for different
          machines, they will have different "namespace scopes".

          These scopes can be the same names as in your run_isis sites file.
	  ISIS will be completely partitioned away from the run_isis copies
          because of the different port numbering.

	* scope2, etc. are optional scopes.  We often list machines by type
	  for convenience here.  Not required and can differ from entry to
	  entry even within a LAN.

With this change ISIS should start right up if you run "isis" from here.

Note that this system configuration does NOT require that ISIS have been
installed.  Moreover, it does not use the "installed" binaries in ../bin
