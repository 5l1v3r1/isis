ISIS V2.1 is basically ISIS V2.0 with a number of bug fixes and few
actual code extensions.

BYPASS mechanisms now work but the new pg_client versions of BYPASS
are not yet available, and this limits the scale on which BYPASS can
be used.  If using BYPASS communication in systems with many overlapping
groups, contact us regarding possible use of the flag ISIS_OPTIMISTIC.
It should now be possible to run all of ISIS with BYPASS enabled.
However, this is not yet the default configuration of the system
(we want a bit more experience with it before we automatically run
this way).

One new feature is the ability to enqueue messages on entry points.
The interface is through the system call msg_rcv().  Also new is a
way to do timeouts in isis_accept_events.  Suggested main loops for
X11 have also changed; see demos/display11.c for an example of one
style that works.  Contact us for ideas on how to code other sorts
of X main loops.

We also want to direct your attention to the new spreadsheet demo
program, which is quite sexy.

To build ISIS for your machine architecture, run "make ARCH", i.e.
"make SUN4" (or "make help" for help)... subsequently, you should
cd to the ARCH directory and run make.

Make "install" installs the files for general use.  You will still
need to make symbolic links, etc, on your own.
